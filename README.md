# Python_Cuda_Abstractions

Comparison of several cuda abstractions in python.
This will help me gauge an approximation between the performance and ease of use offered by differing levels of abstractions.
As I already undestand Cuda c/c++ and I don't wish to learn all the new syntax, I will rely on Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
